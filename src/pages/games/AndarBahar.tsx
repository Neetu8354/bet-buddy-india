        <p>The main <strong>Andar Bahar bet</strong> has near 50/50 odds with a tiny house edge — Bahar pays 1:1 and Andar pays slightly less. The real edge is in side bets: the "First 3 Cards" bet pays up to 120× when the Joker matches in the first 3 deals.</p>
        <p>Smart players bet 80% of their stake on the main game and 20% on a single side bet — this preserves bankroll while capturing the rare 120× hit. Avoid the "Total cards over/under" bet on most tables — it carries the highest house edge (~6%).</p>
